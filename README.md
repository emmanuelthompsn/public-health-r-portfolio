Hi 👋 I'm Emmanuel Thompson, a Ghanaian pharmacist and MS in Public Health student in the U.S.  
Previously, I worked as a production pharmacist at one of Ghana’s largest pharmaceutical companies.  
I am now developing expertise in biostatistics and data analysis, applying data-driven approaches to address global and public health challenges.

## 📊 Featured Project: Week 1 – Cancer Analysis (Base R)
**Goal:** Explore the relationship between fruit & vegetable intake (“5-a-day”) and cancer status using sample health data.  
**Methods:** Chi-squared test for categorical association, independent t-test for mean BMI difference.  
**Results:**
